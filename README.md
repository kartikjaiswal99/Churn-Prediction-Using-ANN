# ðŸ”® Churn Prediction Using ANN

This project demonstrates how to build and train an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for a churn prediction problem.

---

##  Project Overview

* Built an **ANN model** to predict customer churn.
* Used **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for model architecture, training, and evaluation.
* Included an additional notebook for **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize the model's performance.
* Streamlit-based UI (`app.py`) allows simple web-based predictions.
